      <h2><b>Hi there!</b></h2> 
       <p>I am a fourth year student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing my degree in Marketing with a minor in Creative Technology Design.
        I am also in the process of gaining certificates in Leadership and Social Responsibility and Ethics (SRE). I am passionate about anything that brings out 
        my artistic side and I seek to promote inclusion in the workplace throughout my career path.

      <p> When I'm not at school or work, you can usually find me on the pickleball court! </p>
      <p>I have a huge passion for exploring new cultures, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse experiences and see some incredible sights in both Europe and Asia!
      I even dedicated some time to learning Japanese. </p>
      <p> Outside of my adventures, I'm deeply involved in making a difference in my community. Whether it's through my role on the advisory board for Best Buddies or my previous work as a registered behavioral technician, I'm committed to encouraging inclusivity wherever I can.</p>
      <p>Balancing academics and work on my own throughout college has been a journey, but it's one I've navigated successfully. I've landed on the dean's list and participated in programs like Diverse Scholars and the Professional Mentorship program at CU. </p>
      <p>I'm incredibly passionate about all things creative in the marketing world—from logos to full-blown brands—and I hope to create a lasting legacy in my career.</p>
