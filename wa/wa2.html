<p>I am Jade Gordon. My pronouns are she/her. I am a business student with an emphasis in Marketing. I am pursuing two certificates in CESR and leadership with a minor in CTD. I am hoping I can use this class to create a website that can be used as my portfolio for more of my creations and prototypes.</p>
